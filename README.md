# midterm  - shopping intention classifier

## **Problem statement:**

By analyzing data from online sessions of candidate shoppers, the objective is to predict if the session ended with a transaction (gained a revenue) or without a transaction (loss of a revenue).

The target column is 'revenue', a boolean, while the other 17 features can be grouped in:

* statistics on web pages visited during the session: (informational, administrative and product-related),
* (google) analytics data: page_values, bounce_rates and exit_rates and
* time and place of the transaction: (weekend, month, (proximity of) a special_day, region),
* type of operating_system, of browser and of traffic

## **Dataset Information:**

The dataset consists of feature vectors belonging to 12,330 online sessions.

The dataset was formed so that each session would belong to a different user in a 1-year period to avoid any tendency to a specific campaign, special day, user profile, or period.

## **Dataset Origin:**

ICS UCI ML Repository: [UCI Machine Learning Repository: Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention Dataset Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Shoppers+Purchasing+Intention+Dataset))



## Description of the Project and of the steps to reproduce it

The project was executed in a conda environment and the list of dependencies is in requirements.txt  (sorry üòï , there are more than the essential dependencies because the conda enviroment is the one I make use of for the entire ml-zoomcamp course 2022 till now (week 7))

* notebook.ipynb contains EDA and the final Model selection.
  sandbox.ipynb contains a messy :) ,constituted by various experiments that eventually converged in the notebook.ipynb,
* train.py contains the logic for training from CLI the final model detrmined in notebook.ipynb

for the deployment of the model as a service BentoML framework has been used. In particular, service.py and bentofile.yaml are part of the depolyment with bentoml.

* service.py contains the logic for the prediction service.
* bentofile.yaml contains the dependencies.

to try in localhost the service:

bentoml serve service.py:svc --reload

then the service can be checked through a swaggerUI interface in the browser

by executing:

bentoml build

a bento archive is built. The bento definition from the official docs is: 'Bento üç± is a file archive with all the source code, models, data files and dependency configurations required for running a user-defined bentoml.Service, packaged into a standardized format.'. In particular in the bento archive is included a Dockerfile

in order to containeraize the service from the bento archive:

bentoml containerize midterm_classifier:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

where midterm_classifier:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx is the tag of the bento archive (as an example: bentoml containerize midterm_classifier:oah24sc6xgqjouon)

now to serve the prediction as a containerized service, execute:

docker run -it --rm -p 3000:3000 midterm_classifier:oah24sc6xgqjouon
(docker has to be installed to execute the last command.)

As a last note, I made this project in a Linux environment (Ubuntu 22.04) over a Windows OS (win11) by using WSL2 virtualization. Docker Desktop was installed in Windows and VSCode was used as IDE.

Hope you can enjoy!
